#
# This docker compose file assumes that you have set the DOCKER_GCP_CREDENTIALS environment
# variable to point at a json file which contains valid GCP credentials. 
# The credentials file may be either a downloaded credentials file for your personal GCP
# environment (see the Readme) or the credentials than are refreshed by running:
#    $ gcloud auth application-default login
# 
# It is also assumed that the GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environment variable is set. This should contain
# the name of your GCP project, eg, sdc-rh-fred
#
